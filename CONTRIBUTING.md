## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React best practices**
- Use **JSDoc comments** for all functions and components
- Keep components **small and focused** (single responsibility)
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Avoid **deep nesting** (max 3 levels)

### Example Component Structure

```jsx
/**
 * ComponentName
 * Brief description of what the component does
 */

import { useState } from 'react';

/**
 * Component description
 * 
 * @param {Object} props - Component props
 * @param {string} props.title - Title text
 * @returns {JSX.Element} Component
 */
const ComponentName = ({ title }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Follow **mobile-first** approach
- Ensure **dark mode** compatibility
- Test on **multiple screen sizes**
- Use **semantic class names** when custom CSS is needed

### File Organization

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/         # Reusable components
│   ├── layout/         # Layout components
│   └── sections/       # Page-specific sections
├── pages/              # Route pages
├── hooks/              # Custom hooks
├── context/            # React Context
├── constants/          # Constants and config
└── utils/              # Helper functions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.jsx`, `EventCard.jsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useTheme.js`, `useScrollAnimation.js`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.js`, `validateEmail.js`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_URL`, `MAX_ITEMS`)
